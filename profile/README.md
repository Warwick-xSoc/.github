# ðŸ‘‹ Hello!
xSoc is a cross-society collaboration between three University of Warwick Societies:
- [**Computing**](https://github.com/UWCS)
- [**Coding**](https://github.com/Warwick-Coding-Society)
- [**AI**](https://github.com/WarwickAI)

We made a 6-week introductory Python Course together, and the materials for it can be found at:
